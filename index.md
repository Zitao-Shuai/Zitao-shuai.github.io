## About Me
Hi! I'm Zitao Shuai, I'm currently an incoming PhD student at UCLA Computer Science Department advised by Prof.[Yuzhe Yang](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yuzhe/). I'm fortunate to work with Prof.[Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) during my master’s studies, and with Prof.[Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) during my undergraduate's studies. And I'm also a member of [CKC Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) during my undergraduate's studies.

I have broad interests in Research Interests in AI for Healthcare, Trustworthy AI, and Multimodal representation learning.


## Research Interests

- **AI for Healthcare**
- **Multi-modal learning** 
- **Trustworthy AI**


My research interests are in multi-modal learning and AI for healthcare, especially in leveraging multi-source data to deliver trustworthy solutions for real-world healthcare problems. These interests have drawn me to explore two main research questions:

- **Foundation Model for Wearable Data**: How can we build multi-modal foundation models for heterogeneous and long-context wearable signal data?
- **Scientific Finding with Wearable Data**: How can we uncover correclations between diseases and signal data collected from wearable devices with modern AI techniques?

## Outside the Office

I’m a tennis enthusiast and have been playing since I was 9. My favorite player is Rafael Nadal, not only for his exceptional athleticism but also for his remarkable sportsmanship - give his best on every shot until the very end of the match, which inspires me to persevere in my research endeavors and relentlessly pursue my scientific aspirations.
