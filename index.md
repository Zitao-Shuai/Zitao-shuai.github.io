## About Me
Hi! I'm Zitao Shuai, I'm currently an incoming PhD student at UCLA Computer Science Department. I'm fortunate to work with Prof.[Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) during my master’s studies, and with Prof.[Kun Kuang](https://kunkuang.github.io/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) during my undergraduate studies. And I'm also a member of [CKC Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/).

I have broad interests in Research Interests in AI for Healthcare, Trustworthy AI, and Multimodal representation learning.


## Research Interests

- **AI for Science**
- **Trustworthy AI**
- **Multimodal representation learning** 

My research interests are in trustworthy machine learning and AI for science, especially in leveraging real-world multi-modal data to provide trustworthy solutions for healthcare problems. These interests have drawn me to explore two main research questions:

- **Trustworthy Healthcare AI**: How can we ensure the trustworthiness of the healthcare AI models, to provide reliable, fair, transparent, and robust outputs?
- **Multi-modal AI for Science**: How can we leverage heterogeneous multi-modal data to better model practical AI for scientific tasks, especially digital healthcare domain?

## Outside the Office

I’m a passionate tennis enthusiast and have been playing since primary school. I'm a baseline topspin player, right-handed (two-handed backhand). My favorite player is Rafael Nadal, not only for his exceptional athleticism but also for his remarkable sportsmanship, which **inspires me to persevere in my research endeavors and relentlessly pursue my scientific aspirations**.
