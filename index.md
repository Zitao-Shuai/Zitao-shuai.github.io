## Research Interests

- **Bio-Medical AI** 
- **Trustworthy AI**
- **Multimodal representation learning** 

My research interests are in trustworthy machine learning and AI for social goods, especially in leveraging real-world multi-modal data to provide trustworthy solutions for healthcare problems. These interests have drawn me to explore two main research questions:

- **Trustworthy Healthcare AI**: How can we ensure the trustworthiness of the healthcare AI models, to provide reliable, fair, transparent, and robust outputs?
- **Multi-modal AI for Social Goods**: How can we leverage heterogeneous multi-modal data to better model practical AI for social good tasks, especially digital healthcare domain?

## Outside the Office

I’m a passionate tennis enthusiast and have been playing since primary school. I'm a baseline topspin player, right-handed (two-handed backhand). My favorite player is Rafael Nadal, not only for his exceptional athleticism but also for his remarkable sportsmanship, which **inspires me to persevere in my research endeavors and relentlessly pursue my scientific aspirations**.
