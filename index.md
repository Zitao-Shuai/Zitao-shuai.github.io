## Outside the Office

I’m a passionate tennis enthusiast and have been playing since primary school. I'm a baseline topspin player, right-handed (two-handed backhand). My favorite player is Rafael Nadal, not only for his exceptional athleticism but also for his remarkable sportsmanship, which **inspires me to persevere in my research endeavors and relentlessly pursue my scientific aspirations**.
